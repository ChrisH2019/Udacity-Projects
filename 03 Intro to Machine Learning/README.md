# Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch

Learn foundational machine learning algorithms, starting with data cleaning and supervised models. Then, move on to exploring deep and unsupervised learning. At each step, get practical experience by applying your skills to code exercises and projects.

## Unsupervised Learning

In this lesson, you will learn to implement unsupervised learning methods for different kinds of problem domains.

### Create Customer Segments

Use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and use those similarities to segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques. This segmentation is used to help the business make more informed marketing and product decisions.
