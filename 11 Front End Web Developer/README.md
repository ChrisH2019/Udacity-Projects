# Front End Web Developer

The goal of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build and develop a variety of websites and applications. Graduates of this Nanodegree program will be able to construct responsive websites using CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid, develop interactive websites and UI (User Interface) applications using JavaScript and HTML, and connect a web application to backend server data using JavaScript. Students will also build competency automating application build and deployment using Webpack and improving offline performance of websites using Service Worker.

## CSS & Website Layout

Learn how to effectively create the structure of a website using semantic HTML, and style websites with CSS and responsive layouts. Develop an understanding of different use cases for CSS Grid and Flexbox, and structure the layout of a web page using grid columns and rows.

### Styled Blog Website

Create a multi-page blog website, using best practices for content and page styling with HTML and CSS. You’ll practice using responsive layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to create the structure and design for your own blog.

## JavaScript and the DOM

Use JavaScript to control a webpage. Learn what the Document Object Model (DOM) is, and use JavaScript and the DOM to dictate page content and interactions. Gain experience working with Browser Events and managing website performance by controlling content creation efficiently.

### Dynamic Landing Page for Marketing Content

In this project, you will be building a multi-section landing page. Often times, you won’t know how much content will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, you will dynamically add content to a web page. You’ll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.

## Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications

Set up a Node and Express environment so you can develop web applications on your local machine, and learn to handle HTTP Requests & Routes. Update and modify website elements dynamically using asynchronously retrieved data.

### Weather Journal

Apply your new skills to combine data from the OpenWeatherMap API and client side (browser) HTML forms to create a web app that records a weather journal for users. This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather Journal App.

## Build Tools, Webpack, and Service Worker

Develop an understanding of how to use build tools, such as Webpack, for automating build tasks. Create CSS variables with Sass and configure Webpack to use Sass controlled stylesheets. Learn how to cache server data and website functionality using Service Worker.

### Article Analysis Website

Build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new API called Aylien, you can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. This tool will give back pertinent information about the article: whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.

### Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone

In the final project, you’ll combine all of the skills you’ve developed throughout the Nanodegree program to build an online travel app. You’ll work with data sources from multiple APIs to create a dynamic travel weather planning application that helps people plan trips by generating weather forecasts for the places they’re visiting. The design is up to you, and you’ll have the flexibility to include and combine other APIs (even your own!) to build this final project.
