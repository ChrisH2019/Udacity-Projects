                        Marking the continuation of Greek heritage in Chicago, 
                        visitors can explore The National Hellenic Museum, 
                        ride the Greektown Trolly, experience the annual Greek Independence Day parade, 
                        and feast during the Taste of Greece. 
                        Chicago's Greektown is the best sampling of Greek heritage outside of Athens.
