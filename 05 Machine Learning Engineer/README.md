# Machine Learning Engineer

Learn advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms and how to package and deploy your models to a production environment. Gain practical experience using Amazon SageMaker to deploy trained models to a web application and evaluate the performance of your models. A/B test models and learn how to update the models as you gather more data, an important skill in industry.

## Software Engineering Fundamentals

In this lesson, you’ll write production-level code and practice object-oriented programming, which you can integrate into machine learning projects.

### Build a Python Package

Build your own Python package, a skill that every software engineer should have. This exercise will not be required for you to complete this program and, as such, will not be graded.

## Machine Learning in Production

### Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

Build and deploy a deep learning model that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review using Amazon SageMaker. In addition, create a simple web app that uses your deployed model and accepts user input.

## Machine Learning Case Studies

Apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world tasks; explore data and deploy both built-in and custom-made Amazon SageMaker models.

### Plagiarism Detector

Use your advanced machine learning skills to define similarity metrics between two text documents and identify cases of plagiarism. You’ll perform feature engineering and train and deploy a custom, plagiarism-classification model using Amazon SageMaker.
