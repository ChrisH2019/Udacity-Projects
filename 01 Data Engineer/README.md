# Data Engineering

Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets.

## Data Modeling with Postgres

Model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. Create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. Define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables.

## Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. Create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. Model data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

## Build a Cloud Data Warehouse

Build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Build a Data Lake

Build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app. Load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. Deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Data Pipelines with Airflow

Continue working on the music streaming companyâ€™s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. Configure and schedule data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.

## Capstone Project

Build a data warehouse with ETL pipeline from scratch.
