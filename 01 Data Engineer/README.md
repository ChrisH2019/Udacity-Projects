# Data Engineering

Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets.

## Data Modeling

Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

### Data Modeling with Postgres

In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL you will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new tables.

### Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. You’ll model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

## Cloud Data Warehouses

Sharpen your data warehousing skills and deepen your understanding of data infrastructure. Create cloud-based data warehouses on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### Build a Cloud Data Warehouse

In this project, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Spark and Data Lakes

Understand the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets. Store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark.

### Build a Data Lake

In this project, you'll build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app. You will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Data Pipelines with Airflow

Schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. Run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.

### Data Pipelines with Airflow

In this project, you’ll continue your work on the music streaming company’s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. You’ll configure and schedule data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.
