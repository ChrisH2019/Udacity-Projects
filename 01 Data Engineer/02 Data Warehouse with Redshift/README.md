# Data Warehouse

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. I'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, a star schema is created to be optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
    
## ETL Pipeline

1. Create Redshift cluster using Python SDK
2. Create staging, fact and dimension tables for the start schema in Redshift
3. Load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into fact and dimension tables on Redshift

## Getting Started

1. Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3
2. Add values to the following variables in `dwh.cfg`
```
[CLUSTER]
HOST=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PORT=

[IAM_ROLE]
ARN=
```
3. Execute commmand `python3 create_tqables.py`
4. Execute command `python3 etl.py`
5. Upon completing the ETL process, run the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
6. Delete your redshift cluster when finished.
