# Data Pipelines with Airflow

## Introduction

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring me into the project and expect me to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Project Datasets

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

# Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, a star schema is created to be optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Data Pipelines

1. Load event and log data from S3 to stage tables in Redshift
2. Load data from stage tables to fact and dim tables in Redshift
3. Performat data quality check on fact and dim tables

## Getting Started

1. Launch a Redshift cluster and create an IAM role
2. Create stage, fact and dim tables using queries in `create_tables.sql`
3. Copy files in `dags` and `plugins` folders into folders with same folder name in your Airflow webserver directory
4. Add Airflow connections by create variables `aws_credentials` and `redshift` on the **Connections** under **Admin** tab in Airflow UI
