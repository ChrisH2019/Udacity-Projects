# Full Stack Web Developer

The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. A graduate of this program will be able to design and build databases for software applications, create and deploy database-backed web APIs, and secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend. Students will also learn how to deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.

## SQL and Data Modeling for the Web

Master relational databases with the power of SQL, and leverage Python to incorporate database logic into your programs.

### Design a Venue Booking Database

For your first project, you’ll be building out the data models and database for an artist/venue booking application. A prototype design of the web app will be provided. You’ll use SQLAlchemy and Postgresql to build out the data models upon which this site will rely. You’ll write out both the raw SQL and SQLAlchemy commands to run for powering the backend functionality of the website.

## API Development and Documentation

Learn how to use APIs to control and manage web applications, including best practices for API testing and documentation.

### Trivia API

In this project, you will use the skills you’ve developed to build a Trivia API. You will use APIs to control and manage a web application using existing data models. You’ll be given a set of data models and the application front end. Your task will be to implement the API in Flask to make the Trivia game functional.

## Identity Access Management

Implement authentication and authorization in Flask and understand how to design against key security principle. You will also gain experience with role-based control design patterns, securing a REST API, and applying software system risk and compliance principles.

### Coffee Shop Full Stack

The goal is to build the backend for a coffee shop application. You’ll add user accounts and authentication to your application and use role-based access management strategies to control different types of user behavior in the app.

## Server Deployment and Containerization

Develop an understanding of containerized environments, use Docker to share and store containers, and deploy a Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster using AWS

### Deploy a Flask App to Kubernetes Using EKS

In this project, you will create a container for your Flask web app using Docker and deploy the container to a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS. By the end of the project, you will have deployed your application live to the world, where it should be accessible by IP address. You’ll use automated testing to prevent bad code from being deployed and monitor your app’s performance using AWS tools.

### Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone

In this final capstone project, you will combine all of the new skills you’ve learned and developed in this course to construct a database-backed web API with user access control. You will choose what app to build and then you’ll design and build out all of the API endpoints needed for the application and properly secure them for use in any front end application (web or mobile).
