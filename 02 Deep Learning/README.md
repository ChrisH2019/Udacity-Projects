# Deep Learning

Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.

## Neural Networks

Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

### Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

### Dog-Breed Classifier

Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model—this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

### Generate TV scripts

Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.

## Generative Adversarial Networks

Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

### Generate Faces

Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.

### Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. You’ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
